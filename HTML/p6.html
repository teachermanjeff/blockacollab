    <p>“Classical Chameleon” by Laird is an artwork simply of a chameleon as the name suggests. This artwork is very realistic and colourful, almost like it was taken straight out of the camera and into the canvas. It breathes life and colour to a wonderful degree. The background colours give a very warm feel with a very nice pink but the chameleon itself, contrasts the artwork with a very nice blue. Vibrant colours especially in the eyes to signify the chameleon’s ability to change colour. This art interprets the versatility of the chameleon. To choose the colours in its own body and to choose which one fits the right situation. To put it simply, this piece represents the chameleon very well with great, vibrant colours that blend well together to make this spectacular piece of art.</p>
