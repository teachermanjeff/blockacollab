    <p>“Spiteful Red Ball” by Leon is an artwork of a malicious sad red ball. This artwork brings others down. There is a large amount of hate I feel for this piece and if this creature was real then I would assume it would feel just as much hate for me as well. Whenever I’m near it I feel discomfort, this feeling becomes worse and worse the closer I get to it. The red on this ball makes the viewer feel anger with the eyes being a bit of a depressing blue. The malice could be felt on the facial expression of this ball. It all comes together to have every negative emotion coming together into one glob that is this ball. This red ball is the embodiment of hatred. Think of a strong horrible feeling that can control you, that is this art piece. You may feel it for others, objects or even yourself, and it all links back all the way to over here. This art is atrocious. I can’t stand it, with every thought in my mind telling me to look away and to despise it. This feeling is too strong and I can’t handle it. I don’t want to be talking about this anymore than I have. I’m done, I hate you.</p>
