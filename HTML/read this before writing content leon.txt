1. 

if you can, please follow this guideline while content writing:

p1=andy
p2=leon
p3=evelyn
p4=skye
p5=maxim

2: 

i am writing the source code for the pages; please wait until i am finished before making changes.

	OR 

tell me before you make a change so i can look it over and decide.

3: 

maxim is writing the source code for the main page; please wait until he is done before making changes.

	OR

tell him before you make a change so he can look it over and decide.

4:

in case you were confused during the meeting, your job is as follows: you are writing the content in every single page. that means writing all the paragraphs (brief descriptions, paragraph about artwork).

this does NOT include editing the HTML.

i recommend writing all of your articles on a google docs, and then copy pasting them into the code later on. this is to ensure you have something to do while we work on the source code.

if you want to, or are interested in coding something, please tell us beforehand, so we can incorporate your share of the code work early on before everything is done.

i am also willing to switch jobs with you if you want to create the HTML for the pages.

P.S.

ask if you have any questions. this isnt really a "wow, we had one meeting so everything is right in the world!" sort of thing. communication is necessary. this is some real life simulator stuff.
