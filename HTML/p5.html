    <p>“The Gecko” by Maxim is simply an art piece on a gecko. It depicts a gecko in a natural habitat, presumably wandering about. The yellow on the gecko’s scales shines brightly as it stares off into the distance. The main focus here very clearly is the gecko. This artwork exemplifies all of the gecko’s features. To its skin, the scales and the spots. This gecko art piece really feels alive and real. As a gecko sheds its skin, it changes. We as humans do something similar, metaphorically speaking as we change over the course of our lives and sometimes we look back at it. To make judgments on our past. You’re either proud of your accomplishments or to both look down upon and learn from your flaws. To truly make this art better is to make the picture bigger and a little bit clearer in the background to truly make the viewer better envision that the gecko is really there. That doesn’t stop it from being an overall solid art piece.</p>
