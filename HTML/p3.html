    <p>“Ruby’s Birthday” by Evelyn is an artwork of a birthday celebration of a pet dog named Ruby. Ruby has a colourful little necklace around her neck and a cute little crown on her head to signify that she is the important person for today. This art feels human. Not in a sense that the dog feels almost human, no, it’s just that even if this animal is a different species altogether, we still treat them with respect. Enough respect to do usually normal human things like birthdays and sometimes speaking to them as if they were human. We care for them just as much as they care for us. The interpretation is that we should all be equal to each other. Despite our differences, we’re still human and some of us have to learn to respect that. Not everyone can be a good person but if you can then give the people around you a chance. A chance to earn your respect. This artwork is very good and that is my evaluation. To end it off, I want to say happy birthday to Ruby.</p>
