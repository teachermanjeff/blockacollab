    <p>“Skye’s Picture” by Skye is an artwork that depicts a beautiful lake by the sunset. It has a very nice choice of colours, along with a frame that is pleasing to the eye. Seeing this image makes me feel at peace. To enjoy the moments we have now. To savor every second of looking at this piece. Time feels like it flies by so fast sometimes, so don’t take the great moments you have now for granted. Enjoy every second while you still can. You're the youngest you can possibly be so enjoy your lifetime. Savor it and cherish it with yourself or the people you care about most. If you don’t then you’ll regret what you’ve missed later. Astounding art piece. I certainly did enjoy my time here and I hope you did too.</p>
