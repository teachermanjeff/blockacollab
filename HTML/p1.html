    <p>“Llama” by Andy is a very fluffy llama resting upon a grass field. It lays there, with nothing but peace in its mind. There is simply nothing more to this image and that’s okay. I believe that this llama has nothing to care about at this very moment. Nothing is trying to harm it and it has nothing to attend to as it’s just a llama. It’s at serene peace and it does not care. The grass field showcases even more comfort. My interpretation is that you should take care of yourself every once in a while. It’s okay to take a break when you need it. That isn’t to say to slack off till the last moment, you still need to work hard but don’t stress out about it at the same time. I get it if that’s a hard thing to balance but you just have to try your best. A very peaceful drawing, wonderfully done by the artist. Give everything your best like how this artist has done their best on their work.</p>
